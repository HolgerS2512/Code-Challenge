#### Quiz

A quiz is a question or guessing game in which brain teasers and knowledge questions must be answered as correctly as possible.


#### Snake

Snake is a classic computer game in which a snake moving straight or at right angles is steered through a playing field. The aim of the game is to pick up the randomly appearing "morsels" offered as food and avoid obstacles, including your own snake body. As the snake grows with every bite, maneuvering becomes increasingly difficult as the playing field becomes more crowded – and the base rate may be faster.


#### Tic Tac Toe

Tic-Tac-Toe or Three wins (also Circle and Cross, Dodelschach) is a classic, simple two-player strategy game, the history of which dates back to the 12th century BC. Can be traced back.


### **Useful**

#### Stopwatch

The stopwatch is a precise measuring device for the time difference between start and stop.


#### Vocabulary Trainer

A vocabulary trainer is a special form of flashcard software that was specifically developed for learning the vocabulary of a language. They are widespread and available for almost all common operating systems and hardware platforms.


#### Calculator

A calculator is a portable, handheld electronic calculator that can be used to perform numerical calculations. Some newer technical-scientific pocket calculators also master symbolic mathematics using a computer algebra system (CAS), so they can convert or solve equations, for example.


#### Shipping Calculator

The shipping calculator determines the cheapest shipping costs in comparison. To calculate the shipping costs for your package, enter the dimensions and weight of your package shipment. You can also choose preset dimensions and adjust them to your package if necessary.


#### ToDo List

The to-do list or pending list, task list, list of open points (also LOP, 2Do list), open point list (also OPL) is a list in task management or task planning that defines which tasks are pending and who responsible for them and by when they must be completed.


#### Cookbook

The constant cutting out of new recipes from magazines and pasting them into your own cookbook is finally over. Anyone who cooks dishes today and would like to keep the recipes for them simply saves them in the digital cookbook.


### **Gimmicks**

#### Pokedex

The Pokédex (also spelled PokéDex, or Dex for short) is a hi-tech encyclopedic dictionary of Pokémon species that debuted in the very first Pokémon games, Pocket Monsters Aka and Midori. It's a staple of a Pokémon trainer's kit.


#### Hair View

Hair View is a mirror image view. You can choose from a variety of hairstyles, hair colors or beards.
